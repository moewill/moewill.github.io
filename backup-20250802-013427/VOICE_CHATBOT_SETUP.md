   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-deepgram-key-here
   WEBSOCKET_HOST=0.0.0.0
   ```

- **Deepgram**: [console.deepgram.com](https://console.deepgram.com) â†’ API Keys

### 3. Update Website Configuration
1. **Get Railway URL**: After deployment, copy your Railway app URL
2. **Update config file**: Edit `js/chatbot-config.js`
   ```javascript
   const CHATBOT_CONFIG = {
       BACKEND_URL: 'https://your-actual-railway-url.up.railway.app',
       // ... rest of config
   };
   ```
3. **Commit and push** the updated configuration

### 4. Test the Integration
1. **Visit your website**: [moewill.github.io](https://moewill.github.io)
2. **Test text chat**: Click chat button, type a message
3. **Test voice chat**: Click microphone icon, speak a question
4. **Verify responses**: Should get AI responses about your services

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If Railway deployment fails:
- Check Railway logs in dashboard
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure API keys are valid and have credits

### If chat doesn't work:

- Verify Railway URL is correct in config
- Test backend health endpoint: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/health`

### If voice chat doesn't work:
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Try different browsers (Chrome works best)
- Check WebSocket connection in browser dev tools

## ðŸ“Š Expected Costs
- **Railway**: $5-15/month (free tier available)
- **Anthropic**: ~$0.25-1.25 per 1K tokens (Haiku pricing)
- **Deepgram**: ~$0.004 per minute of audio
- **Total**: ~$20-50/month for moderate usage
