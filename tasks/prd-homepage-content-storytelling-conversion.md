# Product Requirements Document: Homepage Content & Storytelling Conversion

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the complete content restructure and conversion optimization of the Maurice Williams AI Automation homepage (moewill.github.io). The goal is to transform the existing homepage into a high-converting sales page using Above the Fold principles, Apple-inspired design aesthetics, and StoryBrand methodology to position Maurice Williams as the go-to provider of privacy-first AI automation for $1M+ coaches and consultants.
