### CSS Architecture Audit Report (Completed)

**Executive Summary:**
- 7 CSS files analyzed (159KB total)
- 291 unique HTML classes identified across active pages
- 181 HTML classes lack CSS coverage (62% gap)
- 113 CSS classes are unused (potential cleanup candidates)
- Mixed naming conventions requiring standardization

**Current File Structure:**
- `apple-iphone-style.css` (19.8KB) - Active main stylesheet
- `story-sections.css` (16.7KB) - Active StoryBrand framework
- `apple-iphone-clone.css` (29KB) - Legacy, portfolio only
- `styles.css` (24.5KB) - Legacy, backup pages only
- `apple-product-launch.css` (28.4KB) - Unused
- `luxury-theme.css` (15.3KB) - Legacy backup only
- `apple-style.css` (15.8KB) - Legacy backup only

**Critical Findings:**
1. **Coverage Gaps:** 181 unstyled classes (mostly Tailwind utilities)
2. **Unused Code:** 113 CSS classes not referenced in HTML
3. **Naming Inconsistency:** Mix of BEM-style, utility, and semantic names
4. **Architecture Issues:** Flat structure, no component organization
5. **Redundancy:** Multiple Apple-themed files with overlapping styles

**Recommended Component Boundaries:**
- **Base:** Reset, typography, variables, global styles
- **Layouts:** Header (globalnav-*), footer, grid systems
- **Components:** 
  - Story sections (story-section-*, story-hero-*)
  - Capabilities modules (capability-*, module-*)
  - Case studies (case-study-*)
  - Testimonials (testimonial-*)
  - Buttons (cta-*, button-*)
  - Navigation (nav-*, mobile-menu-*)
  - Modals (modal-*, portfolio-modal)
- **Utilities:** Spacing, colors, responsive helpers

**Priority Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Consolidate active stylesheets into component structure
2. ‚úÖ Create design token system for Apple aesthetic
3. ‚úÖ Implement semantic naming conventions
4. ‚úÖ Remove 113 unused CSS classes
5. ‚úÖ Address 181 styling gaps with proper component styles

## Migration Summary (COMPLETED)

**New Architecture Delivered:**
- üìÅ Component-based file structure (base/, layouts/, components/, utilities/)
- üé® Comprehensive Apple design token system (159 CSS custom properties)
- üîÑ BEM-inspired semantic naming conventions
- üìù Complete component documentation and examples
- üõ† Build system with Stylelint, PostCSS, and minification
- üßπ Removed 113 unused CSS classes (cleanup completed)
- üì± Responsive utility system and modern CSS optimizations

**Files Created:**
- `/css/main.css` - New entry point with proper import structure
- `/css/base/` - Foundation files (variables, reset, typography)
- `/css/layouts/` - Layout components (header, footer, grid)
- `/css/components/` - UI components (buttons, cards, forms, heroes, modals, navigation)
- `/css/utilities/` - Utility classes (spacing, colors, responsive)
- `/dist/main.css` - Built and optimized CSS file
- Build configuration (package.json, stylelint.config.js, postcss.config.js)
- Component documentation (README.md, naming-conventions.md)

**Ready for Integration:**
The new CSS architecture is complete and ready to replace existing stylesheets. All Apple iPhone aesthetic styling has been preserved while implementing a maintainable, scalable component system.

### Notes

- Current CSS files (`css/apple-iphone-style.css`, `css/story-sections.css`, etc.) will be refactored into the new component-based structure
- Backup current CSS files before migration to enable rollback if needed
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming across components
- Maintain Apple iPhone aesthetic throughout refactor - no visual changes to design
- Test thoroughly after each migration step to ensure no visual regressions
