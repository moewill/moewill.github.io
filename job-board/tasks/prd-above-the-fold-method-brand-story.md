## Technical Standards
- **Content Management**: Integrate with existing Apple-style website structure
- **Messaging Hierarchy**: H1 → Problem/Solution, H2 → Plan Steps, H3 → Authority Builders
- **SEO Integration**: Maintain existing keyword strategy while improving message clarity
- **Performance**: No impact on current site loading speeds
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure story elements work across all device sizes

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Visual design changes to existing Apple aesthetic
2. New website development or major structural changes
3. Logo redesign or brand identity changes
4. Multi-service brand development (focus on DevSecOps only)
5. International market messaging

## Future Iterations

2. **V3**: Industry-specific story variations (healthcare, fintech, etc.)
3. **V4**: Video content series based on story framework
4. **V5**: Partner/referral messaging using story elements

## Design Considerations
- **Maintain Current Aesthetics**: Keep existing Apple-inspired design while updating content
- **Story Flow Integration**: Ensure smooth narrative progression through existing page structure
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Use current typography system to emphasize story elements
- **Call-to-Action Placement**: Strategically position CTAs at story climax points

## Technical Considerations
- **Content Integration**: Update existing HTML/CSS without structural changes
- **SEO Preservation**: Maintain current search rankings while improving message clarity
- **Analytics Tracking**: Implement story-specific conversion tracking
- **A/B Testing**: Framework should support testing different story variations

## Success Metrics
### Primary Metrics

## Open Questions
1. What specific SOC2 compliance success stories should be highlighted as authority builders?
2. Should we create industry-specific versions of the hero profile?
