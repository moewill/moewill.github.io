# Task List: Portfolio Page with Job Board Integration

Based on PRD: `prd-portfolio-page.md`

## Relevant Files

- `portfolio/index.html` - Main portfolio page with project showcase and modal system (✅ Created)
- `portfolio/projects.json` - JSON data structure containing all project information (✅ Created)
- `../index.html` - Main website navigation updated from "Job Board" to "Portfolio" (✅ Modified)
- `job-board/index.html` - Job board page integrated via iframe in portfolio modal (✅ Integrated)

### Notes

- Since this is a static site for GitHub Pages, we'll use a single HTML file with embedded JavaScript and Tailwind CSS
- No traditional unit tests needed as specified in PRD (vanilla JavaScript, static site)
- Projects JSON will be loaded dynamically for easy management and future additions
